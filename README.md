This project shows the use of hardware to write and read within a document with a .txt extension located in a micro SD memory using the arduino uno card.

In this project, the microSD card adapter is used to read the files contained within a microSD memory, making a connection through the SPI communication protocol to the Arduino Uno development board.


When executing the script with a microSD inserted in the adapter, the project opens the test.txt file, if it does not exist, it is created and inside it is written "It was written correctly in the file, congratulations!!!" then the content is read inside the test.txt file and the result is shown in the serial monitor
